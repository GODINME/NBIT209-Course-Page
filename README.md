# NBIT 209 Data Structures and Algorithm

## Course Description:  
* This course will cover abstract data types and basics of algorithms, Linked lists, stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, heaps, and graphs. Students will also be taught how to derive big-Oh analysis of basic algorithms. C++ will be our language of choice for implementing our ideas in this class. Below are useful C Plul Plus material for revision if you have forgotten your programming fundamental in year one.
* We will be making heavy use of Git, Github and Project Management Tools
